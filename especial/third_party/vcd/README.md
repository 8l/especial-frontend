# Value change dump

Value change dump (`vcd` files) are use to dump signals values and plot timing diagrams.

Vcd files are generated automatically and they can be opened with any compatible viewer. Many viewers are available, from EDA tools to Eclipse plugins.
[Impulse](http://toem.de/index.php/projects/impulse) is a free and open source Eclipse plugin that I use.
